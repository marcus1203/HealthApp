1. Assessment Theme: Digital Nutrition
The Digital Nutrition Journey: Food Quality Score Visualisation Application
Introduction
Digital health technologies have transformed how we monitor, assess, and improve our health outcomes. Within this domain, nutrition applications represent a significant advancement in helping individuals understand and enhance their dietary patterns. This article provides an in-depth explanation of a specialised nutrition application focused on food quality score visualisation‚Äîspecifically designed for patients who have already undergone professional dietary assessment.

Take a look at this official guide from Australian Government's Department of Health and Ageing: 


Unlike general consumer applications such as MyFitnessPal that primarily focus on calorie counting and macronutrient tracking, this application (that we will build as part of this assignment) serves as an extension of clinical care. It bridges the gap between professional dietary assessment and the daily nutritional choices patients make in their lives, providing them with personalised insights based on scientifically validated dietary quality metrics. In the next section, we'll unpack more about dietary assessments.

Understanding Dietary Assessment and Food Recalls
Before exploring the application's functionality, it is important to understand the clinical process that precedes its use. When patients visit a dietitian or nutritionist, one of the primary assessment methods used is a food recall survey. This procedure involves the healthcare professional conducting a structured interview where patients describe in detail everything they have eaten and drunk over a specified period‚Äîtypically the previous 24 hours.

During this recall process, the clinician records not only what foods were consumed but also details including:

Portion sizes and quantities

Methods of preparation

Timing of consumption

Contextual factors such as where and with whom the meal was eaten

This detailed information provides clinicians with comprehensive data about a patient's dietary patterns, nutrient intake, and overall eating behaviours. The clinician then analyses this information using standardised tools that generate various nutritional assessments, including a food quality score based on established dietary guidelines.

The Healthy Eating Index for Australian Adults (HEIFA-2013) represents one such scoring system, evaluating the degree to which an individual's diet aligns with the Australian Dietary Guidelines. This multidimensional assessment examines consumption patterns across various food groups including vegetables, fruits, whole grains, protein sources, dairy products, and discretionary foods, while also considering factors such as sodium, sugar, and alcohol intake.

In Brief
As part of this unit's major assessment (60% spread over A1 & A3) you will build a digital nutrition app called NutriTrack that helps patients visualise their food quality scores after they have visited a clinician/dietician and conducted a food recall survey.

The Food Quality Score Visualisation Application represents an important advancement in nutrition technology that bridges clinical assessment and everyday dietary choices. By helping patients understand their personalised dietary quality scores through intuitive visualisations and providing actionable, evidence-based recommendations, the application empowers individuals to make informed nutritional decisions.

For IT students developing this application, the project offers rich learning opportunities across technical, design, and health domains. Most importantly, it provides experience creating technology that has tangible impacts on health outcomes‚Äîturning abstract nutritional guidance into practical, personalised support that helps individuals navigate their nutritional journey with confidence and clarity.

By focusing on visualisation, education, and behavioural support rather than simply tracking calories or macronutrients, this application exemplifies how thoughtfully designed technology can extend and enhance the impact of clinical care, ultimately supporting better nutritional choices and improved health outcomes.

This assessment spec was designed by Delvin Varghese in association with Associate Professor Tracy McCaffrey (Department of Nutrition, Dietetics and Food at Monash University). The spec is based on a current real-world problem faced in the field of Nutrition Studies.

2. The Problem in Digital Nutrition
The Role of the Food Quality Score Visualisation Application
After patients have completed their clinical assessment, they often leave with a wealth of information but may struggle to contextualise this information or translate it into actionable changes. This is where our specialised application provides significant value.

The application allows patients to claim their profile using their unique identifier provided by their healthcare professional. Upon accessing their account, patients can view a comprehensive visualisation of their food quality scores derived from their recall survey data. Rather than presenting this information as complex numerical data, the application translates these scores into intuitive visual representations that clearly communicate dietary strengths and areas for improvement.

The core purpose of this application extends beyond mere data presentation. It serves as a personalised nutrition companion that provides:

Contextualised Interpretation: Helping patients understand what their scores mean in relation to dietary guidelines and health outcomes.

Targeted Recommendations: Suggesting specific, actionable changes based on identified areas for improvement within their dietary pattern.

Motivational Support: Delivering positive reinforcement for healthy choices while providing encouraging messages to support dietary changes.

Educational Content: Offering evidence-based information about nutrition principles in accessible language.

Goal-Setting Framework: Enabling patients to set realistic, incremental goals for dietary improvement.

3. How Mobile Apps can help!
Technical Foundation and User Experience
From a technical perspective, the application integrates with clinical systems to securely access patient data. The scores generated from the food recall survey are stored in a structured format (typically CSV files) that the application can interpret and transform into visual representations.

The user experience is designed to be intuitive and accessible, even for individuals with limited technological proficiency. After completing a simple authentication process to claim their profile, patients navigate through a series of screens that progressively reveal different aspects of their dietary assessment:

Overview Dashboard: Presents a comprehensive summary of their overall food quality score and key metrics.

Detailed Breakdown: Shows performance across individual dietary components (vegetable intake, fruit consumption, whole grain choices, etc.).

Comparative Analysis: Places their scores in context by comparing them to reference values from dietary guidelines.

Recommendation Centre: Provides personalised suggestions for dietary improvements based on their specific scores.

Resource Library: Offers educational materials including recipe ideas, meal planning tips, and nutritional information.

The application employs data visualisation techniques specifically designed to communicate nutritional concepts clearly, using colour coding, intuitive icons, and progressive disclosure of information to prevent overwhelming users.

Behavioural Science Foundation
The application is built upon established principles of behaviour change theory, recognising that knowledge alone is rarely sufficient to drive sustainable dietary improvements. It incorporates elements such as:

Self-Monitoring: Enabling patients to track their progress over time.

Goal Setting: Facilitating the establishment of specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) nutritional goals.

Positive Reinforcement: Celebrating achievements and improvements, no matter how small.

Implementation Intentions: Helping patients plan specific actions for overcoming barriers to dietary change.

Social Support: Providing options to share progress with healthcare providers or support networks.

The integration of these behavioural techniques transforms the application from a simple data visualisation tool into a comprehensive dietary support system.
